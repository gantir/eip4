Definitons:

* Convolution: The operation in which we overlay an given image and derive the significant features of the same in a reduced dimension.
* Filters/Kernels
* Epochs: Each epoch is one complete run over which the algorithm sees all the training inputs and learns. We train the algorithm over multiple such runs known as epochs.
* 1x1 Convolution
* 3x3 Convolution
* Feature Maps
* Activation Function
* Receptive Field
